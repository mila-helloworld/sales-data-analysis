# Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes a mock sales dataset generated with **Mockaroo**.  
We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create visualizations to explore sales trends by **region, category, and product**.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `sales_data.csv` → Mock sales dataset  
- `analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with EDA & visualizations  

## Key Steps
1. Load and explore dataset (info, summary statistics, missing values)  
2. Group and analyze sales by region, category, and product  
3. Create visualizations to highlight sales patterns  
4. Summarize insights and potential next steps  

## Results
- Electronics is the top-performing category  
- The South region generated the most revenue  
- Certain products (like laptops and monitors) consistently drive higher sales  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use **Python for EDA** and **data visualization**.  
It can easily be extended with:
- Time-series analysis (sales over months/years)  
- Customer segmentation  
- Predictive modeling
